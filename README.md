# TimeLord
A simple school timetabling application built using C Sharp. For a modern online version created as an improvement, check out [TimeLordOnline](https://github.com/OhmGeek/TimeLordOnline).

NB: This is no longer being properly updated, although I might end up coming back to this at some point.

## What does the program do?
The program itself allows for managing of rooms, staff and lessons within a timetable. It allows dragging and dropping of lessons, with clash detection. Printing of multiple different timetables can be done using the appropriate dialog box.

Icons used are from the noun project.

## Reason for development

The program was written as part of my A-Level in Computing. I had to design some system, with a client. This is the technical aspect of the project, with the documentation being in a separate PDF format.

## Compatibility

This program was tested under Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1, although it should work with 10 as well. If you use Mono, you can probably get it working on Linux/Mac too, although I haven't tried that. That might require some tweaking.

## Possible improvements I could make
- Solve an optimization problem (automatically place lessons)
- Make printing nicer
- Redesign the GUI (as it could be better - I'm using a picturebox)
- Add more Doctor Who references (e.g. exterminate for the delete button)

NB: I probably won't end up improving this anytime soon, as I would prefer to do a full rewrite of the project than continue with the current codebase - I made several errors during development, which resulted in me having to search through many lists, rather than using pointers. It's not ideal, and in some cases quite slow. However, on a moderately sized school, with relatively OK specs (i5 processor, 4GB RAM), the program runs fine.
